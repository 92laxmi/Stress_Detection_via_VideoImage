# Stress_Detection_via_VideoImage

This project implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset. It identifies seven emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral. The system is built using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, and includes live video feed integration to classify emotions in real-time with high accuracy. Additionally, it provides stress level analysis and corresponding relaxation suggestions based on the detected emotions.
